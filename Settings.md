# MSOfficeSVN customization guide

## Shortcut key settings

### Excel

1. Exit Excel.

2. Set the value of `ShortcutKeyOnOff` key to 1 in the `[ShortcutKey]` section of `excelsvn.ini` that has been copied during installation.
```
[ShortcutKey]
ShortcutKeyOnOff=1
```

3. Edit the parts that assign shortcut keys to SVN commands depending on your needs.
```
Update="+^{u}"
Commit="+^{i}"
Diff="+^{d}"
RepoBrowser="+^{w}"
Log="+^{l}"
Lock="+^{k}"
Unlock="+^{n}"
Add="+^{a}"
Explorer="+^{e}"
```

`+` means `Shift` key and `^` means `Ctrl` key. The alphabet that is braced by {} means the alphabet key.\
In the above example, the `Update` command is triggered when the `Shift` key, `Ctrl` key and `u` keys are pressed at the same time.

Refer to [dev\_ExcelOnKey](https://github.com/msofficesvn/msofficesvn/wiki/dev_ExcelOnKey) about key notation.

4. Re-start Excel and confirm that shortcut keys work.


### Word

1. Exit Word.

2. Set the value of `ShortcutKeyOnOff` key to 1, and the value of `Registered` key to 0 in the `[ShortcutKey]` section of `wordsvn.ini` that has been copied during installation.
```
[ShortcutKey]
ShortcutKeyOnOff=1
Registered=0
```

3. Edit the parts that assign shortcut keys to SVN commands depending on your needs.
```
;Shift+Ctrl+u
Update1=256
Update2=512
Update3=85

;Shift+Ctrl+i
Commit1=256
Commit2=512
Commit3=73

...
```

Assign shortcut key codes to `<Command Name><No.>` keys.

In the above example, the `Update` command is triggered when the `Shift` key, `Ctrl` key and `u` keys are pressed at the same time.
| Key | Key code |
|:----|:---------|
| Shift | 256 |
| Ctrl | 512 |
| u | 85 |

Refer to [dev\_WordKeyCode](https://github.com/msofficesvn/msofficesvn/wiki/dev_WordKeyCode) about key codes.

4. Re-start Word and confirm that shortcut keys work.

5. If you wish to change the shortcut key assignment furthermore, make sure to set the value of `Registered` to 0 in the `[ShortcutKey]` section of `wordsvn.ini` **before you start Word**. The value of `Registered` is set to 1 when you start Word and shortcut key assignment is registered. If the value is not 0, the shortcut key assignment is considered already registered, thus not applied.


## Clear the shortcut keys assignment

### Excel

1. Exit Excel.

2. **EITHER** remove or comment out the line(s) corresponding to the shortcut you want to disable.
```
;Update="+^{u}"
```

3. **OR** set the value of `ShortcutKeyOnOff` key to 0 in the `[ShortcutKey]` section of `excelsvn.ini` that has been copied during installation.
```
[ShortcutKey]
ShortcutKeyOnOff=0
```

4. Re-start Excel and confirm that shortcut keys are disabled or that originally assigned functions are invoked.
